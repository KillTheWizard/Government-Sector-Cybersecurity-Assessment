## Overview

This project focuses on the critical need to safeguard government data and infrastructure in an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated. It highlights the consequences of cybercrime, such as financial losses and public trust erosion, while providing insights into risk management strategies.

---

## Purpose and Objectives

- **Purpose**: To evaluate and mitigate the cybersecurity risks faced by government entities.
- **Objectives**:
  - Analyze cyber incidents affecting government agencies.
  - Provide actionable recommendations using frameworks like NIST 800-30.
  - Enhance awareness of threats posed by third-party contractors and internal vulnerabilities.

---

## Case Studies

The analysis includes three key case studies:
1. **City of Hesperia Breach**: Explores the risks and response to unauthorized access to personal information.
2. **J.B. Hunt Transport Inc. Breach**: Discusses the impact of misconfigurations in cloud services and third-party management.
3. **Marines Memorial Association Breach**: Highlights the vulnerabilities within military-affiliated organizations and the implications for national security.

---

## Key Findings

- Cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated and persistent, targeting government infrastructure at all levels.
- Vulnerabilities in cloud services, internal access controls, and third-party contractors pose significant risks.
- Insider threats and portable device breaches remain critical challenges.

---

## Recommendations

1. Implement proactive threat detection and incident response measures.
2. Strengthen cloud security and enforce rigorous configuration controls.
3. Enhance training for internal staff and third-party contractors to mitigate insider threats.
4. Adopt comprehensive risk management frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-30).

---

## Technologies and Frameworks

- **NIST 800-30**: Risk Management Framework.
- **Privacy Rights Clearinghouse Data**: Source of breach information.
- **Threat-Oriented Analysis Approach**: Methodology for risk evaluation.
